A replica of the Google Gemini website to refine my frontend development skills. This project focused on replicating design elements, responsiveness, and interactive features, giving me hands-on experience with modern web technologies. It allowed me to improve my attention to detail, practice advanced styling techniques, and deepen my understanding of user interface design.
